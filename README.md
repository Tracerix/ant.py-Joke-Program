# ant.py-Joke-Program

I made a little joke program with Python. I decided to distribute it.

ant.py can generate THOSAUNDS of windows, tkinter windows, and special effects.

This doesnt actually harm your computer. This is just a little thing that can freeze your computer. 

Still, be careful running this with unsaved data. I can't be held responsible if something goes wrong.

NOTE: BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION, SAVED ALL UNSAVED DATA!
